# Front-end

Course Project for the Software Development Skills: Front-End course.

There isn't really any tricks to running my project:
it can be done with e.g. the Live Server addon on VS Code,
but the simplest way is to navigate to https://jannejjj.github.io/Front-end/
which is a GitHub Pages page with my deployed project on it.
